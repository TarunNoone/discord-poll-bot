# Meme Submission and Poll Bot
This discord bot was made with a very specific discord server in mind, but in essence its a submission taking and polling bot.

# Working
+ So essentially it takes in an image submission from a user through the command ```;submit``` and adding an image along with the text in the message.
+ After a submission has been recieved, it creates a poll in a separate channel (ideally so that no one should be able to send messages on it) and the poll counts votes through specific reactions (['❤', '💛', '🖤'] --> these three to be exact).
+ The bot then counts the votes and makes a decision based on the votes.
+ The bot is basically playing god here.


# Stuff to Work on Later
1. Add a ```;help``` command to help people with the working of the bot.</li>
2. Limiting reactions made by a person to 1 reaction/vote.</li>
3. Other minor fixes.</li>
