# Meme Submission and Poll Bot
This discord bot was made with a very specific discord server in mind, but in essence its a submission taking and polling bot.

<h1>Working</h1>
<ul>
<li>So essentially it takes in an image submission from a user through the command ;submit and adding an image along with the text in the message.</li>
<li>After a submission has been recieved, it creates a poll in a separate channel(ideally so that no one should be able to send messages on it) and the poll counts votes through specific reactions (['❤', '💛', '🖤'] --> these three to be exact).</li>
<li>The bot then counts the votes and makes a decision based on the votes.</li>
<li>The bot is basically playing god here.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Stuff to Work on Later</h1>
<ol>
<li>Add a ;help command to help people with the working of the bot.</li>
<li>Limiting reactions made by a person to 1 reaction/vote.</li>
<li>Other minor fixes.</li>
</ol>
